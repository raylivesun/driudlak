# driudlak ([wolfram/system-modeler](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/))

Driudlak is a fictional language mentioned in the book "The Silmarillion" by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a constructed language used by the Elves of Eregion, and it is known for its complex grammar and intricate vocabulary. The name "Driudlak" itself is not a word in English, but it is a combination of the words "driud" (elf) and "lak" (language).
